# gobptree

Provides several _nearly_ non-blocking B+Tree data
structures. Deletions fail the not-blocking test because they must
lock the tree from the root node down to the leaf node where a
key-value pair is stored until the deletion completes. Insertions and
Search functions are non-blocking.

  * Int32Tree
  * Int64Tree
  * StringTree
  * ComparableTree

Int32Tree is optimized to use builtin int32 type values for the datum
keys. Int64Tree is optimized to use builtin int64 type values for the
datum keys. StringTree is optimized to use builtin string type values
for the datum keys. ComparableTree is designed to use any data
structure type as a datum key that implements the Comparable
interface. Namely, any data structure that has `Less(interface{})
bool`, `Greater(interface{}) bool`, and `ZeroValue() Comparable`
methods. Examples of this flexible B+Tree implementation are provided
in the `godoc` documentation as well as the test files for the
ComparableTree type.

---

Each B+Tree data structure in this library provides the following
methods, each of which is described below.

  * Delete(key)
  * Insert(key, value)
  * Search(key)
  * Update(key, callback)
  * NewScanner(key)

Insertions in all of the B+Tree data structures from this library are
highly parallelizable, because the nodes will be pre-emptively split
while traversing down from the root to the leaf if necessary rather
than having split nodes bubble back up from the bottom. This is not
only faster, but allows the tree to release the lock on the parent
node before visiting the child nodes, allowing other operations to
continue in parallel that would otherwise block on the node lock.

Like `Insert`, B+Tree `Search` only holds the lock on each node until
the appropriate child node is discovered, so they will not impede
insertions or other search operations.

In contrast to `Insert` and `Search`, however, invoking `Delete` from
the tree, require the lock to be held on each node in the tree until
the algorithm bubbles back up during the final stage of
recursion. This is because the tree will not know whether or not nodes
must borrow from their siblings or merge with their sibling until
after the child node has completed its deletion operation.

The `Update` method will search for the specified key and invoke the
specified callback function with the key-value pair associated with
that key, and then finally update the stored value for the key with
the value provided by a callback's return value. If the specified key
was not found, `Update` still invokes the callback function and stores
its return value in the tree as a new key-value pair.

Additionally this library provides a `NewScanner` function that
returns a cursor that allows enumeration of all nodes equal to or
greater than the specified key. The cursor data structure returned by
each of the B+Tree structures' `NewScanner` method each provide the
following interface. The cursor is designed to be used somewhat
similarly to `bufio.Scanner`, and an example is provided.

  * Close: releases the resources held by the cursor early
  * Pair: returns the key-value pair referenced by the cursor
  * Scan: returns true when additional key-value pairs remain

For example, if a tree has keys for all int64 values from 0 through
1000, calling `NewScanner(10)` will return a scanner that lazily
iterates through all key-value pairs from 10 through 100. However, if
the tree held all odd values from 1 to 100, `NewScanner(10)` would
return a cursor that lazily enumerated all key-value pairs from 11
to 99. Note that if one go-routine is walking through values from the
tree while another go-routine adds a new value, the new value will be
included in the enumeration provided the insertion completes before
the enumeration arrives at the specified leaf node where the key is
found.
